### Hello 👋

### :construction_worker: Currently working on:
- [Legba](https://github.com/LillySoftwareConsulting/Legba), a desktop app (WPF) to help me when submitting requests to LLMs.
- [CSharpExtender](https://github.com/ScottLilly/CSharpExtender), a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottLilly.CSharpExtender/) with extension methods, base classes, etc. that I often use in projects. Working on the 3.0 version, which will be .NET 8.0.

### :book: Currently researching:
- Integrating my local LLM computer into my development process.
