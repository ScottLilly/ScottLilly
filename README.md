### Hello ðŸ‘‹

### :construction_worker: Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [Legba](https://github.com/LillySoftwareConsulting/Legba), a desktop app (WPF) to help me when submitting requests to LLMs.
- [CSharpExtender](https://github.com/ScottLilly/CSharpExtender), a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottLilly.CSharpExtender/) with extension methods, base classes, etc. that I often use in projects. Working on the 3.0 version, which will be .NET 8.0.
- [RobustAPITemplate](https://github.com/ScottLilly/RobustApiTemplate), a template for enterprise-quality REST APIs in C# **NOTE:** Due to much of this being in .NET Aspire, I may stop work on this project.

### :book: I'm currently researching
- Incorporating AI in custom line-of-business applications.
